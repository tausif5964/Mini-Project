## Installation

To get started with Zahra, you'll need to install the necessary libraries and set up your environment. Follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- An internet connection for accessing APIs and online resources

### Install Required Libraries

Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following commands:

```bash
pip install subprocess32
pip install SpeechRecognition
pip install Py-OS
pip install wolframalpha
pip install pyttsx3
pip install wikipedia
pip install DateTime
pip install web-browser
pip install requests
pip install pywhatkit
pip install beautifulsoup4
pip install ecapture
pip install pyttsx3
pip install PyAudio
pip install transformers
pip install newspaper3k
pip install nltk
pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib


### Download NLTK Data

The project uses the NLTK library for sentiment analysis. Run the following command to download the necessary NLTK data:

```python
import nltk
nltk.download('vader_lexicon')
```

## Usage

Once the libraries are installed, and the setup is complete, you can start Zahra by running the `assistant.py` script. Zahra will greet you and begin listening for your commands.

```bash
python assistant.py
```

### Voice Commands

Here are some voice commands you can use with Zahra:

- **Wikipedia Search**: "Wikipedia [topic]"
- **Movie Suggestion**: "Suggest a movie"
- **Open YouTube**: "Open YouTube"
- **Play Music**: "Play [song name]"
- **Get News**: "News"
- **Take a Photo**: "Camera" or "Take a photo"
- **Shutdown System**: "Shutdown system"
- **Lock Window**: "Lock window"

### GUI Interaction

Zahra also features a graphical user interface (GUI) for user-friendly interaction. The GUI provides buttons and text areas for displaying information and executing commands.

- **Speak Button**: Press the "Speak" button to activate Zahra's voice recognition.
- **Text Area**: Displays the output of Zahra's responses and actions.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The core programming language used to develop Zahra.
- **SpeechRecognition**: Library for recognizing speech and converting it to text.
- **pyttsx3**: Text-to-speech conversion library.
- **Transformers**: Hugging Face's library for natural language processing tasks.
- **NLTK**: Natural Language Toolkit for sentiment analysis.
- **BeautifulSoup4**: Library for web scraping and parsing HTML content.
- **Tkinter**: Python's standard GUI toolkit.

## How it Works

### Initialization

- Zahra starts by initializing the speech recognition and text-to-speech engines.
- It sets the voice to a female assistant and adjusts the speaking rate and volume.

### Command Listening

- Zahra listens for user commands using the microphone.
- The `takeCommand` function captures audio input and processes it into text.

### Natural Language Processing

- Zahra uses Hugging Face's Transformers library for summarization and question answering.
- NLTK's SentimentIntensityAnalyzer analyzes user sentiment to recommend movies.

### GUI

- Zahra's GUI is built using Tkinter, allowing users to interact with the assistant via buttons and text input.

### Example Workflow

1. **Greet the User**: Zahra welcomes the user and offers assistance.
2. **Listen for Commands**: Zahra listens for voice commands and processes them.
3. **Execute Tasks**: Based on the command, Zahra performs tasks like fetching news, playing music, or recommending movies.
4. **Respond**: Zahra provides feedback and updates to the user through speech and the GUI.
